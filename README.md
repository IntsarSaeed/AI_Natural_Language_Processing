# AI_Natural_Language_Processing
Natural Language Processing using Python

In this project, I train a Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier.
The SGC is trained using the following document-term vectors:
  1) Unigram representation
  2) Bigram representation
  3) Unigram representation with TF-IDF
  4) Bigram representation with TF-IDF
  
After each training the model is tested and the corresponding output files are generated.
